# CNN_MNIST_Data


First, I train a fully connected network with layers of size 300, 200, 100 and made a final output layer of size 10 with a softmax activation.
I evaluate the model and plot the accuracy over the number of epochs. 

Then, I train a Convolutional Neural Network with 2 Conv2d layers, one pooling layer, a flattening layer, and a dense layer for the output.

I compary the accuracies.
